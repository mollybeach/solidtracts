# Replit Solidity Template
Welcome to the world of Ethereum development and web3! This is a beta template for Solidity development on Replit.

## Getting started
**Just press the `Run ▶️` button!**

- You should only need to do this once. This will install all relevant packages, start up the contract deployment UI, and compile your `contract.sol` file.

- `contract.sol` will automatically recompile whenever you edit them, and they'll be available to deploy immediately from the UI.

- Pressing `cmd-s` or `ctrl-s` (windows) will reload the UI.

We have preinstalled all packages from `@openzeppelin`. To install other solidity packages that are distributed on npm, make sure you install them using the Package Installer :package: in the sidebar

## Future work

We're working on some other features for making development here a lot easier, which are included, but not limited to:

- Our own testnet + faucet
- LSP support for solidity
- Integration with hardhat for "local" (in-repl) testing
- An actual solidity REPL for quickly prototyping / testing functions or lines.

## Feedback

Please leave any comments on this repl's [spotlight page here](https://replit.com/@replit/Solidity-starter-beta?v=1).

The UI is subject to change (and still needs some real responsive work), so we'd appreciate any feedback there. 

We're also trying to improve the overall dev experience, especially for beginners, so any feedback there is appreciated.
